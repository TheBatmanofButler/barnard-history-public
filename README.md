Pedal Technologies was commissioned by Barnard College to set up a database and visual data explorer devoted to the history of the institution. We collaborated with Prof. Robert McCaughey to digitize his research on the people and events in Barnard's history. The data portal is currently under development, but will eventually be available at https://barnardhistory.org/.

## Features

### Database
- Users can search a MongoDB-powered database of people, places, documents, and events beyond the 120+ year history of Barnard College

### Visual Explorer
